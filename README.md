 A quick way to do your calculations for your tips.
 
 I made this so that you can avoid the harass of doing the math and just jump straight to it. No more stress when you are eatting or drinking out. 
 
 There is a tax feature for calculating the tax in your meal. The purpose of this is mostly for groups and what portion of the tax does everyone owe. It does not make sense that you only ate a $15 worth meal in NYC and you have to put $3 for tax, when everyone else ordered more expensive food and they want to split the tax. Pay your meal, not everyone's else.
